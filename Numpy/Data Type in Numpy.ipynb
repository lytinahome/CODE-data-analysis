For example, when we define an integer in Python, such as ``x = 10000``, ``x`` is not just a \"raw\" integer. It's actually a pointer to a compound C structure, which contains several values.\n",

    "- ``ob_type``, which encodes the type of the variable\n",
    "- ``ob_size``, which specifies the size of the following data members\n",
    "- ``ob_digit``, which contains the actual integer value that we expect the Python variable to represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that there is some overhead in storing an integer in Python as compared to an integer in a compiled language like C.\n",

    "Here ``PyObject_HEAD`` is the part of the structure containing the reference count, type code, and other pieces mentioned before.\n",
